# DAM Android practices

This is a repository to upload my Android practices to the module (subject) PMDM (Programación Multimedia y Dispositivos Móviles) (Multimedia Programming and Mobile Devices) of 2nd of DAM (Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Multiplataforma) (Mutiplatform Application Development) of FP (Formación Profesional) (or Vocational Training). Studied at I.E.S. Ginés Pérez Chririnos in the 24/25 academic year.

- Unit 1 - Your first Android App.
    - Practice 1
    - Practice 2
        - Previous Practices Requirement:
            - Happy Birthday Project from [Android Codelab](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-text-composables#0) renamed to [SimpleTextApp](https://github.com/xabyer/dam-android/tree/main/T01p02/PreviousPractices/SimpleTextApp)

            - Happy Birthdayy Project + Image from [Android Codelab](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-add-images#0) renamed to [SimpleImageTextApp](https://github.com/xabyer/dam-android/tree/main/T01p02/PreviousPractices/SimpleImageTextApp). The most important modification I made to this practice was to add a vertical scroll to the text because it doesn't fit on small devices. The rest are minior customizations of sizes and fonts of no importance.
